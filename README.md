Proactive Alerts: Notifies users in predicted high-risk zones, with a clear disclaimer that the prediction is AI-generated and requires user verification.

🔄 Barter & Emergency Trade System
An in-app system for cashless exchange of essential goods and services. Users can list items they have and what they need in return.

⚡ Vehicle-Based Charging Hubs
Allows users with car inverters to register their vehicle on the map as a free, mobile charging station for others.

⚖️ Complaint & Fraud Reporting
A dedicated page for users to report scams, fraud, or misuse of the platform to a higher authority, ensuring a safe and trustworthy environment.
